# Unity-Shader-Playground
This is my first look at shader manipulation in Unity.

In this project you will find a Unity scene with the zombunny 3D model from Unity's [Survival Shooter Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/survival-shooter-tutorial) and few custom shaders I developed while following Penny de Byl's [course](https://www.udemy.com/unity-shaders/learn/v4/overview) in Udemy.

There are simple properties exploration, textures manipulation, lighting models, rim lighting, silhouette outlines, etc.

## Useful imports
- [Unity HDRI](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/unity-hdri-pack-72511), this asset package contains cubemap textures and others useful to see the result of certain shaders.
