# Unity-Shader-Playground üìêüéÆ
This is my first look at shader manipulation in Unity.

In this project you will find a Unity scene with the zombunny 3D model from Unity's [Survival Shooter Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/survival-shooter-tutorial) and a few custom shaders I developed while following Penny de Byl's [course](https://www.udemy.com/unity-shaders/learn/v4/overview) in Udemy.

There are simple properties exploration, textures manipulation, lighting models, rim lighting, toon shading, silhouette outlines, stencil buffer manipulation, vertex extruding, waves, texture scrolling, glass distortion, plasma effect, etc.

## Useful imports
- [Unity HDRI](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/unity-hdri-pack-72511): this asset package contains cubemap textures and others useful materials to see the result of certain shaders.
- [Unity Standard Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-32351): I used a few more complex 3D models from this package to test my shaders.
